    user: "Can you see my schema? I'm working on the orders table.",
    reply: `Yes — I can see <code>ecommerce_demo</code>. You've got an <code>orders</code> table with ~480K rows, <code>created_at</code> indexed... wait, actually it's <em>not</em> indexed. That's your problem right there. 🙃 Full schema: <code>id</code> (bigint PK), <code>customer_id</code> (→ customers), <code>created_at</code> (timestamptz, <strong>unindexed</strong>), <code>amount</code> (numeric 10,2), <code>status</code> (text). What are you trying to run?`
  },
  "slow-query-deep": {
    user: "The daily revenue query is slow — runs in 3s on prod",
    reply: `3 seconds. On 7 days of data. Yep — sequential scan on <code>created_at</code>, ~480K rows, no filtering shortcut. The fix is embarrassingly simple:\n\n<code>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_created_at ON orders (created_at DESC);</code>\n\nAfter that: under 80ms. Also stash the daily rollup in a materialized view and your dashboard will feel instantaneous. Want me to write the full view? Install PgStudio and I'll generate it against your live schema.`
  },
  "slow-revenue": {
    user: "Why is my daily revenue query slow?",
    reply: "Ah yes, the classic 3-second dashboard query — I call it the 'morning coffee loading screen'. Your <code>orders.created_at</code> is getting a full table scan. One index and a materialized view and you'll wonder why you ever waited.\n\n<code>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_created_at ON orders (created_at DESC);</code>\n\nRun that and watch it drop to sub-100ms. Install PgStudio and I'll show you the EXPLAIN diff live, before and after. 📈"

    user: "Analyze this result set and share insights",
    reply: "That's exactly what I'm here for. Give me a slow query, a weird join, or just paste your <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> output and I'll tell you what the planner is thinking (and why it's wrong).\n\n• Total revenue: <code>$158,487.90</code> across <code>1,149</code> orders\n• Peak day: <code>2026-04-11</code> with <code>$27,905.40</code> from <code>191</code> orders\n• Trend: <code>2026-04-13</code> is ~43% higher than <code>2026-04-07</code> — momentum is up\n\nOnce you install PgStudio I'll have live access to your actual schema — no more guessing column types."

  },
  "review": {
