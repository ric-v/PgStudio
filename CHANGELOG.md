# Changelog

All notable changes to the PostgreSQL Explorer extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.6] - 2026-05-13
> Nightly releases - v1.3.9

### Added

- **Role Designer** — Added a new visual role-management editor from the role context menu, with live SQL preview, notebook handoff, and membership controls for Inherit / Admin Option grants.
- **Notebook parameter bank** — SQL parameter prompts now remember values per notebook, offer quick-pick reuse, and let you clear saved values without affecting other notebooks.
- **Streaming row counts** — Sliding-window result rendering now shows the total row count when it is available, so streamed results read as `start–end of total` instead of only a range.

### Changed

- **SQL completion catalog** — Column completion warm-cache queries now read from PostgreSQL catalogs directly, which improves coverage for views and materialized views.
- **Result cursor metadata** — Cursor window messages now carry optional total-row metadata through the renderer path.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-05-07
> Nightly releases - v1.3.6 • v1.3.7 

### Added

- **Plan Studio** — Added a dedicated workspace for deep `EXPLAIN` analysis with plan comparison, flame graphs, and performance recommendations.
- **Schema designer ERD import/export** — Added DBML import, multi-schema ERD support, and export/migration draft helpers.
- **Query result renderer upgrades** — Added lazy-loaded chart, analyst, and explain tabs, plus a more modular renderer pipeline for query results.

### Changed

- **Telemetry and status UX** — Added explicit telemetry mode controls and a status-bar indicator, with message handling updates across the extension.
- **Dashboard and saved queries** — Refreshed dashboard rendering and saved-query flows to match the new message/result model.
- **Connection and AI settings** — Updated the connection form, AI settings panel, and chat webviews to support the new workflows.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-05-03
> Nightly releases - v1.3.3 • v1.3.4 • v1.3.5

### Added

- **Backup and restore** — Database backup and restore from the extension: connection/database selection, a dedicated backup/restore webview with guided options, `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` (and related) argument builders with safe identifier handling and extra CLI args parsing, task-provider integration for scheduled dumps from VS Code, and clearer logging and errors across the flow. Chat assistant gains backup-oriented tooling and prompts where relevant.
- **PostgreSQL server version awareness** — New server-version helper so the extension can adapt queries and metadata reads; SQL helpers and the database tree use the live server version for better behavior on PostgreSQL 10 and 11. SQL completions and the DDL viewer incorporate version-aware paths where capabilities differ by release.

### Changed

- **Database commands** — Refactored database command surface to align with the new backup/restore entry points and shared resolution of connections for external tools.
- **Chat webview** — Wiring updates to support backup-related assistant flows alongside existing chat behavior.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **Multi-statement failure strategies** — Added `postgresExplorer.query.executionFailureStrategy` so long SQL batches can keep going, stop hard, or ask you what to do next.
- **Execution summaries** — Mixed results now end with a clear markdown recap, so you can see what succeeded, what failed, and how far the cell got without digging through noise.
- **Dangerous SQL transaction UX** — Risky SQL now asks once per cell and gives you a safer `Execute in Transaction` path with an explicit COMMIT/ROLLBACK follow-up.
- **Result AI toolbar** — The result actions are easier to find now: a proper toggle reveals the strip when you need it, and **Add to chat** sends the query, sample rows, and helpful context without extra clicking.
- **Telemetry modes** — Choose between no telemetry, basic usage counters, or detailed performance buckets. It stays behind VS Code's global telemetry switch and is surfaced where you can actually change it.
  - Dashboard: WAL/checkpointer/version-safe stats; unused-index severity; statement stats if extension present.
  - Connection test/save: TCP preflight; SSL cert paths for verify modes.
  - Webviews: typed message IDs + validation; shared panel CSS; chat CSP nonce.
  - Saved-query import: counts + merge by id/title; CI triggers documented; tree item keys; What’s New `command:` URIs.
- **SQL completion warm cache** — Completions can reuse a warm cache tied to notebook metadata, with invalidation when the tree or executed SQL updates schema-related context.
- **ERD 2.0 across schemas & DBML import** — Schema designer adds commands to open an ERD spanning multiple schemas and to import DBML for visualization and workflow (DBML parsing via `@dbml/core`).
- **Lazy result tabs** — Chart, analyst, and explain experiences load on demand in the notebook result renderer to keep heavy UI off the critical path.

### Changed
- **Improved SQL keyword suggestions**: Notebook SQL suggestions now pay attention to where you are in the query, so the list feels less random and more helpful.
- Query analysis now explains ALTER impact more clearly and asks for confirmation more consistently when a change could hurt production.
- Telemetry now uses explicit modes and sinks, with lifecycle, usage, and optional performance events routed more intentionally.
- Connections no longer silently relax SSL in production, and AI providers are kept on an allowlist with a guard for empty messages.
- Grid preferences now return structured responses, coverage merges happen before reporting, and `.cursor/` is ignored.
- **SQL completion depth** — Parser support for stripping comments and normalizing identifiers; completions respect `search_path`-changing statements, derived subquery aliases, and session metadata; shared completion helpers consolidated.
- **Schema designer / ERD** — ERD panel and webview reorganized into focused modules (queries, types, HTML, DBML import, export/migration draft helpers); AI settings/chat templates updated alongside AI service wiring.
- **Notebook result renderer** — Chart.js registration is idempotent; large result rendering split into dedicated modules (`renderQueryResult`, review/edit helpers) for clearer structure and easier maintenance.

### Fixed
- Explorer favorites key typo (trailing space).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Sliding-window result streaming**: Large `SELECT` results can now stream in windows instead of overwhelming the grid, with a bounded buffer, a configurable row cap, and a hint banner you can dismiss when you already know the feature.
- **`bytea` display modes**: `bytea` values now show up the way you expect, whether you prefer `hex0x`, PostgreSQL `\x` text, or a JSON-friendly debug shape.
- **SQL Assistant turn controls**: You can regenerate the latest reply without repeating yourself, branch from an earlier turn, or prefill the composer when you want to move faster.
- **Result grid toolbar & editing workflow**: The result grid now feels steadier to work in, with a clearer toolbar, better banners, and a final commit check before edits are written back.

### Changed
- **Export vs Auto-LIMIT**: Exports now rerun the original SQL instead of the display-limited query, so CSV/JSON/Excel downloads can include everything you asked for.
- **Renderer & executor integration**: Windowed fetches and edit commits are coordinated in the extension host so the UI stays aligned with what the database is actually doing.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **SQL Assistant editor tabs**: You can open SQL Assistant in the main editor now, which makes the flow feel less cramped when the sidebar is not enough.
- **Multi-tab SQL Assistant workflow**: Multiple assistant tabs are supported, so you can keep separate conversations going without losing your place.
- **AI Insights dashboard panel**: The dashboard now surfaces schema health, connection analytics, vacuum progress, and direct Ask AI actions in one place.

### Fixed
- **SQL completion deduplication**: Table and column suggestions are deduplicated before caching, so notebook autocomplete stops repeating itself.
- **Assistant routing consistency**: Chat attachments and assistant updates now follow the active SQL Assistant webview, which keeps multi-tab conversations in sync.
- **Review changes UI stability**: The result review / compare UI now renders more consistently and keeps actions aligned with the active table state.

### Changed
- **Dashboard telemetry expansion**: Dashboard stats now show unused indexes, sequential scans, table bloat, autovacuum progress, tables needing vacuum, and connections grouped by application name.
- **Dashboard AI interactions**: You can launch AI prompts from the dashboard, run queries for analysis, download CSV from AI-assisted results, and get notified when health starts slipping.

### Removed
- **Tree filter commands**: `postgres-explorer.filterTree` and `postgres-explorer.clearFilter` removed from activation — these experimental commands were unused.

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Anthropic model discovery**: AI Settings now pulls Anthropic models from the official `/v1/models` API, so the list stays in sync without manual upkeep.
- **Guided chat responses**: Assistant replies can now offer numbered follow-ups, optional next-step bubbles, and the occasional well-placed factoid or joke when it actually helps.

### Changed
- **AI key lookup**: Direct AI provider keys now resolve from `SecretStorage` first, which prevents the frustrating false "API key required" message when the key is already saved.
- **Chat identity and styling**: Assistant messages are labeled **PG Studio Bot**, with clearer contrast and quote styling that makes replies easier to read.
- **Composer UX**: The chat input and suggestion bubbles were tightened for readability and kept from carrying stale next-step actions between chats.

### Fixed
- **Follow-up selection**: Typing a number now picks the matching follow-up question from the previous assistant message instead of starting over.
- **Next-step carry-over**: Next-step bubbles now stay tied to the active conversation, so they do not leak into the next chat.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-03-21

### Added
