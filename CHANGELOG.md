---

## [0.8.8] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Command palette — release notes**: **PgStudio: Show Release Notes / What's New** is registered in the manifest for discovery (changelog opens in an editor-area webview panel).
- **Tests**: Integration coverage for notebook renderer message flow (`NotebookRendererFlow.test.ts`) and unit tests for query save/delete handlers (`QueryHandlers.test.ts`).
- **Table Designer (create mode)**: Drag-and-drop column reorder with clear create-vs-edit UI behavior.
- **AI chat**: Explicit **production safety** rules in the system prompt (read-first bias, transaction/rollback guidance, guarded writes).

### Changed
- **Sidebar layout**: **Connections** and **SQL Assistant** are listed first; **Saved Queries** and **Query History** use new view identifiers and start **collapsed by default** (VS Code only applies manifest defaults when it has no prior UI state for that view).
- **Release notes**: **What's New** is no longer a sidebar section; use the command palette command. Automatic release-note panels on upgrade are not shown on activation.
- **Notebook inline edits**: `SaveChangesHandler` and bulk/table deletes use **parameterized** `UPDATE`/`DELETE`, run inside a **transaction** (`BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` on failure), and build predicates with proper identifier quoting (fixes composite-key and NULL edge cases).

---

## [0.8.6...0.8.7] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **.pgpass support**: Native backwards-compatible support with explicit resolvers parsing standard `.pgpass` (and Windows `%APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf`) secret files.

### Fixed
- **Authentication Resilience**: Resolved standard connection `password authentication failed` issues that fell back to implicit OS defaults incorrectly. 
- **SSL Fallback Reliability**: Fixed `DatabaseTreeProvider` stripping configuration details (such as direct inline passwords and sslmode) during fallback client re-trigger calculations.
- **.pgpass lookup scope**: Avoided resolving implicit machine name environments by strictly isolating parsing searches for explicit username options, fixing backward compatibility for local `trust` authentications.

---

## [0.8.4...0.8.5] - 2026-02-19
    
### Added
- **Visual Table Designer**: A robust, interactive UI for creating tables. Define columns, data types, constraints, and foreign keys visually without writing SQL.
- **Visual Index & Constraint Manager**: Manage indexes and constraints with a modern GUI. Analyze usage, drop unused indexes, and create new constraints with ease.
- **Smart Paste**: Intelligent clipboard handling that detects SQL, CSV, or JSON content and offers context-aware actions (e.g., "Insert as Rows", "Format SQL").
- **Dashboard Improvements**:
    - **Visual Lock Viewer**: Diagnostic tree view to identify and resolve blocking chains and deadlocks.
    - **Enhanced Metrics**: Real-time charts for IO, Checkpoints, and System Load.
    - **Active Query Management**: Kill/Cancel blocking queries directly from the dashboard.

### Improved
- **Stability**: Fixed dashboard template loading issues to ensure reliable rendering on all platforms.

### Fixed
- https://github.com/dev-asterix/PgStudio/issues/56 - Resolved local AI model API implementation with support for http and custom port.

---

## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-14

### Added

### Improved
- **Message Handling Architecture**: Refactored internal message routing to a robust `MessageHandler` registry pattern for improved stability and maintainability.

---

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Advanced Saved Queries System**: Complete redesign with tag-based organization, connection context preservation, AI metadata generation, and rich metadata display.

- **Tree View Organization**: Queries grouped by collapsible tag groups; untagged queries displayed separately.

### Improved
- **Notebook Integration**: Saved queries now open directly in `.pgsql` notebooks with full connection metadata (connectionId, databaseName, schemaName) automatically restored.
- **Query Discovery**: Rich tooltips with creation/last-used dates, database name, connection name, and usage count on tree items.

---

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-08

### Added
